# App Store Submission Preparation

## Logging System Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive logging system to prepare your app for App Store submission. This system automatically disables all debug logs in release builds while preserving them during development.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created Logger Utility:**
   - Location: `Shiori Reader/Utilities/Logger.swift`
   - Purpose: Provides debug-only logging with various severity levels
   - Features: Auto-disabled in release builds, file/line tracking, categorized logs

2. **Updated EPUBNavigatorCoordinator:**
   - Replaced all `print()` statements with appropriate Logger calls
   - Categorized logs for better organization
   - Added proper severity levels (debug, info, warning, error)

3. **Build Configuration Management:**
   - Location: `Shiori Reader/Utilities/BuildConfig.swift`
   - Purpose: Centralized management of build-specific settings
   - Features: Debug mode detection, feature flags, App Store preparation

4. **App Delegate Configuration:**
   - Added automatic logger configuration based on build type
   - Added App Store submission preparation call

5. **Debugging Tools (Debug-only):**
   - Location: `Shiori Reader/Utilities/DebugMenu.swift`
   - Purpose: Runtime control of debug features
   - Features: Toggle logging, force log tests
   - Note: Completely removed in release builds

6. **Documentation:**
   - Location: `Shiori Reader/Utilities/README-Logging.md`
   - Purpose: Explains the logging system and how to use it

## How It Works

1. In **DEBUG** builds:
   - All logs are visible in the console
   - Debug menu is available for runtime control
   - Detailed logging with file/line information

2. In **RELEASE** builds (App Store):
   - All debug logs are completely removed (zero performance impact)
   - Debug menu is completely removed
   - Only critical error logs remain visible
   - App Store preparation is automatically performed

## Next Steps

To complete preparation for the App Store:

1. **Replace Remaining print() Statements:**
   - Search your codebase for any remaining `print()` statements
   - Replace them with appropriate Logger calls
   - Example: `Logger.debug(category: "YourCategory", "Your message")`

2. **Build Testing:**
   - Test both Debug and Release builds to verify logging behavior
   - Ensure Debug builds show logs and Release builds don't

3. **Consider Adding Debug Menu:**
   - Add the `DebugMenuButton` to your app's settings or developer screen
   - This provides runtime control of logging in debug builds

## Code Example

```swift
// Replace print statements like this:
print("DEBUG: User logged in successfully")

// With Logger calls like this:
Logger.debug(category: "Authentication", "User logged in successfully")
```

The custom logging system ensures your app is clean and optimized for App Store submission while maintaining powerful debugging capabilities during development.
